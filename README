Now the desktop files internationalization is handled trough xml-i18n-tools;
so DON'T EDIT THOSE FILES DIRECTLY, they will be overwritten; instead
edit the corresponding *.in file.

In those *.in files each entry preceded by an underscore (_) means there
can be localized entries; eg:

_Foo=blablalbnla

means the produced desktop file will be like:

Foo=blablalbnla
Foo[ab]=dfsdfsdf
Foo[xy]=cpakgdoijnqd

etc.

The translations are taken from the po files in the po directory.
